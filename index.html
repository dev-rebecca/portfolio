          <p>
            After working in a couple of different industries, I finally bit the
            bullet in January 2021 and decided to go after my passion of website
            development, all guns blazing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast forward to not even a year later – I’ve learned SO much and
            somehow my interest in learning the tools of the trade has grown
            even stronger. I’m hungry to create solutions for people with code.
          </p>
          <p>
            I see full-stack web development as the best of both worlds… art VS
            science. Applying technical knowledge with out-of-the-box thinking
            and creativity.
          </p>
          <p>
            My dream now is to find my forever home: a forward-thinking &
            culture driven Brisbane-based company that allows me to hone my
            skills and become the best version of myself every day.
          </p>
          <p>A few technologies I know well:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>PHP</li>
            <li>MySQL</li>
            <li>Tailwind CSS</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Some technologies I’m currently working on improving my knowledge
            of:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>React</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>Typescript</li>
          </ul>
          <div
            class="bg-gray-200 rounded-full w-72 h-72 justify-self-center"
          ></div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="min-h-screen" id="projects">
        <h2 class="text-5xl uppercase">Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Here’s a showcase of the two projects I’m the most proud of. Creating
          these was inspiring and fulfilling because they had real-world
          application to them.
        </p>
        <h3>Wildlife Watcher</h3>
        <p>
          A labour of love, I made this app to fulfill a wish I had to keep
          track of the wildlife in my local area.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to create the entire project with vanilla JavaScript to
          ensure I had a depth of skill before moving onto learning front-end
          frameworks.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>REST API</li>
          <li>Tailwind CSS</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
          <li>MySQL</li>
          <li>Google Maps API</li>
          <li>Image handling</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>PHEM</h3>
        <p>(Paul Humphries Electromechagnomics)</p>
        <p>
          This was created based on a competition we had at TAFE to create a website for Paul, a client in need of a Wordpress site for his ___ business.
        </p>
        <p>
          We pitched our creations to Paul, and thankfully he chose my site as the one he wanted to use moving forward. I now look after Paul’s site.. and something.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wordpress</li>
          <li>Customised PHP theme</li>
          <li>Extensions</li>          
        </ul>

        <p>If you’re seeing this you’ve probably received my CV with my full details. I’d love the opportunity to meet you for an interview and demonstrate my dedication first-hand.</p>
